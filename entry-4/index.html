<h2>The Beauty of Slowness</h2>
<p>Writing a letter or postcard takes time — choosing the paper, holding the pen, waiting for the ink to dry. Unlike instant messages, a letter carries the writer’s rhythm, emotions, and small imperfections. Each word feels slower, more thoughtful. That’s what makes it special.</p>

<h2>A Tangible Connection</h2>
<p>When we send or receive a letter, we are not just reading words — we are touching something that traveled across distance and time. The handwriting, the stamps, even the small wrinkles in the paper all tell a story. It feels personal in a way that screens cannot replace.</p>

<h2>The Lost Habit</h2>
<p>Today, letters are rare. We text, email, and send emojis instead. It’s faster, easier, and practical — but sometimes, it feels too clean, too temporary. A handwritten message, even a short one, can last for years in a drawer or a box, holding memories that a chat bubble never could.</p>

<h2>The Postage Stamp 🕊️</h2>
<p>The small stamp in the corner of a postcard may seem unimportant, but it holds its own story. It marks where the message began — a city, a country, a moment in time. The design of a stamp often reflects a nation’s art, culture, and values. For the receiver, it’s a tiny piece of another world. Collecting stamps or simply noticing them reminds us that communication once had a journey — slow, physical, and meaningful.</p>

<h2>Why It Still Matters</h2>
<p>Letters remind us that connection can be slow, imperfect, and deeply human. Bringing back this practice — even once in a while — is like bringing warmth back into communication. It’s not about nostalgia, but about remembering that sometimes the most meaningful things take time.</p>
