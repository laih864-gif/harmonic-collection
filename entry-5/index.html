    <h1>Threads of Time</h1>

    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <p>Knitting is a simple but focused activity. It’s built from two basic moves — knit and purl — repeated over and over. From these small motions, a scarf, hat, or pair of gloves slowly takes shape. The process requires patience, but it’s also calming. Your hands move, your mind slows down, and time passes in a steady rhythm.</p>

    <h2>Connection</h2>
    <p>Each knitted piece carries traces of time and effort. The texture shows how long it took, how the yarn stretched or twisted, and sometimes even small mistakes. These details make every piece different. Knitting connects the maker with the material and, often, with the person it’s made for.</p>

    <h2>The Pace of Time</h2>
    <p>Knitting can’t be rushed. Each row takes time, and the results come slowly. This is what makes it different from digital work — you see progress little by little. It’s a reminder that not everything needs to be instant.</p>

    <h2>Small Mistakes</h2>
    <p>Dropped stitches, uneven tension, or knots in the yarn — these things happen. They don’t ruin the work; they just show it’s made by hand. The small imperfections give the piece character and honesty.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Knitting teaches patience. It helps us focus, take breaks from screens, and use our hands again. In a fast, digital world, spending hours making something real can feel refreshing. Each finished piece is not just an object — it’s time turned into something you can hold.</p>
