    <h2>The Art of Waiting</h2>
    <p>Film cameras are not just machines to take pictures — they are tools that keep memories alive. Each photograph begins with loading a roll of film, followed by the quiet click of the shutter, and finally, days or even weeks later, the images appear in a darkroom or photo lab.</p>
    <p>Unlike digital cameras, which give instant results, film forces us to slow down and wait. This waiting is not just a delay — it changes how we experience photography. Instead of taking hundreds of shots without thinking, film encourages us to pause and be more mindful. The gap between taking a picture and seeing the result adds mystery and excitement. Every roll feels like a story that takes time to unfold.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Film photography became popular in the early 1900s, when companies like Kodak made cameras small, affordable, and easy to use for everyday people. For the first time, anyone could capture family life, travels, and personal memories. Through most of the 20th century, film was the main way we recorded history — from personal photo albums to famous documentary images.</p>
    <p>Even though digital photography took over in the 2000s, film never truly disappeared. In recent years, it has returned with surprising strength. Younger generations, who grew up with digital cameras and smartphones, are discovering film for the first time. They are attracted by its grain, its colors, and its imperfections. For them, film feels different: slower, more physical, and more real.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>To use a film camera, you load a roll of film, set the aperture and shutter speed, and press the shutter. Unlike digital, you cannot check the picture right away. The negatives must be developed with chemicals and then printed or scanned. This waiting makes each photo feel more intentional. Small surprises like light leaks, grain, or unusual colors often add to the charm.</p>

    <h2>Developing Film</h2>
    <p>The magic of film continues after pressing the shutter — it happens in the darkroom or at the photo lab. Developing film is a slow, careful process:</p>
    <p>
      1. <b>Loading</b>: Put the film into a light-tight tank.<br>
      2. <b>Chemical Baths</b>: Developer brings out the image, stop bath ends the process, fixer makes the image permanent.<br>
      3. <b>Drying</b>: The film is washed and dried.<br>
      4. <b>Printing & Scanning</b>: The negatives are printed in a darkroom or scanned for digital use.
    </p>
    <p>This process makes every roll of film feel like opening a gift — full of surprises.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Each roll has only 24 or 36 shots, so every click feels important. Film slows us down, makes us think, and shows that photography can be physical and intentional. Film photos are not just files on a screen — they are real objects we can hold, share, and treasure.</p>
