    <h1>Cassette Tapes</h1>

    <h2>The Charm of Imperfection</h2>
    <p>
      A cassette tape is never perfect — and that’s what makes it beautiful. The soft hiss beneath the music, the gentle
      warping of sound, the subtle imperfections that come from time and touch. Unlike digital audio, which is polished
      and flawless, a cassette feels alive. It breathes. Every listen is slightly different, shaped by the machine that
      plays it and the hands that rewind it.
    </p>
    
    <h2>A Physical Memory</h2>
    <p>
      Sliding a cassette into a deck, pressing <em>play</em>, feeling the buttons click — it's a ritual. A moment of pause
      before the music begins. There is something deeply grounding in that small sequence of actions. The tape itself
      becomes a memory object: a concert someone recorded, a mixtape from a friend, a soundtrack to a time in life. The handwriting on the label, the scratches on the plastic, the fading ink — every detail tells a story. A cassette
      is not just audio; it’s a fragment of a moment, carried through years.
    </p>

    <h2>The Mixtape Gesture</h2>
    <p>
      Before playlists were a click away, a mixtape required intention. Choosing songs, arranging them carefully, recording
      them in real time — crafting a mixtape meant thinking about the listener with every track. It was an act of patience,
      thoughtfulness, and affection. A mixtape wasn’t shared instantly. It was given. And receiving one meant knowing someone spent hours shaping something
      just for you — a quiet, personal kind of love.
    </p>

    <h2>The Rewind</h2>
    <p>
      Rewinding a cassette is its own kind of slowness. Watching the spools turn, waiting for the moment when the tape clicks
      back into place, is a reminder that not everything needs to be instant. Music used to take time — to queue, to rewind,
      to revisit. That pause creates space. Space to listen. Space to feel. Space to remember.
    </p>

    <h2>Why It Still Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Cassette tapes endure not because they are convenient, but because they are honest. They capture the warmth of sound,
      the marks of time, the presence of the person who recorded them. They remind us that music can be imperfect and still
      deeply meaningful — maybe even more meaningful because of its imperfections. In a world of endless streaming and frictionless choice, a cassette offers something rare: a moment of physicality,
      intention, and slow listening. Sometimes, the things we have to wait for are the ones that stay with us the longest.
