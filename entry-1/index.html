  <h1>The Warmth of the Tangible</h1>

  <h2>10 Words About Tangible</h2>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This website is a collection of tangible objects â€” a small archive of things that can be touched, held, and kept. It explores why these items still matter and what kind of warmth they bring in contrast to digital media.</p>

    <h2>Why Tangible Matters</h2>
    <p>In today's electronic society, almost everything has turned into screens and files. Yet physical objects carry a unique sense of presence: the texture of paper, the weight of a vinyl record, or the sound of a cassette tape spinning. They feel alive in a way that digital cannot replace.</p>

    <h2>My Perspective</h2>
    <p>I have always been drawn to real, physical things. A handwritten note feels more personal than a text message, and listening to music on a CD or vinyl feels more intentional than streaming. These objects create simple rituals and moments of connection that bring comfort and warmth.</p>
