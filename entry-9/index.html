    <h1>Handmade Pottery</h1>

    <h2>Clay and Hands</h2>
    <p>Handmade pottery begins with something very simple: a lump of clay and a pair of hands. The clay is soft, heavy, and a little stubborn. As you press, pull, and turn it, the material slowly responds. It remembers every touch, every correction, and every hesitation. Unlike working on a screen, where changes can be undone with one click, shaping clay means committing to each movement. The form that appears is not only the result of skill, but also of the body’s rhythm and mood in that moment.</p>

    <h2>From Raw Clay to Vessel</h2>
    <p>The process of making pottery moves through clear stages. First the clay is wedged to remove air, then centered on the wheel or shaped by hand. A cylinder becomes a cup, a bowl, or a vase as the walls are pulled up and thinned. After drying, the piece is trimmed, fired once, glazed, and fired again. Each step changes the object a little — the color shifts, the surface hardens, and the form becomes more permanent. Watching this transformation from soft earth to solid vessel makes the final piece feel almost like a small, quiet story.</p>

    <h2>Traces of the Maker</h2>
    <p>Even when a pot looks simple, it often carries many small traces of the maker. A slightly uneven rim, a fingerprint pressed into the base, or a subtle wobble in the curve can all reveal the way it was made. These marks are not mistakes to be erased, but signs that the object passed through human hands. Unlike factory ceramics, which aim for identical perfection, handmade pottery accepts variation as part of its character. Each piece has its own personality, shaped by moments of decision and chance.</p>

    <h2>Glaze, Surface, and Color</h2>
    <p>Glaze adds another layer of complexity. A potter chooses a glaze, but cannot fully control the outcome. Heat, atmosphere, and placement in the kiln all affect the result. Sometimes the color runs more than expected, sometimes small specks appear, sometimes two glazes react in an unexpected way. These changes can be frustrating, but they are also where some of the most beautiful surfaces come from. The final piece may show soft variations in tone, glossy pools, or dry, matte patches that invite touch.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>In everyday life, a cup or bowl can seem like a small thing. But when it is handmade, it changes how we notice it. We feel the weight, the balance, and the warmth of the clay when it holds tea or soup. The object turns a daily routine into a small, physical experience. Handmade pottery reminds us that even practical things can hold time, attention, and care. It fits naturally into the theme of this collection: objects that are slow, tangible, and full of the traces of human touch.</p>
