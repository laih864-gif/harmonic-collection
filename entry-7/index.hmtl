    <h1>Books & Paper</h1>

    <h2>The Weight of Words</h2>
    <p>Old books carry more than stories — they carry time. Their yellowed pages, the faint smell of ink and dust, and the soft crackle when you turn a page all remind us that reading used to be a slower act. You could feel the texture of the paper, see the marks of age, and know that others once touched the same pages before you.</p>

    <h2>Traces of Time</h2>
    <p>Every old book has a history. Some have underlined sentences, notes in the margins, or a pressed leaf between the pages. These traces make each copy unique — a quiet record of someone else’s thoughts and moments. Even worn corners or small stains become part of its identity, showing how the object has lived through time.</p>

    <h2>Paper as Memory</h2>
    <p>Paper absorbs more than ink; it keeps the atmosphere of the moment it was written or printed. Letters, receipts, notebooks — they all hold fragments of life. Unlike digital text, which feels weightless, paper changes as it ages. Its surface darkens, softens, and becomes more fragile — like memory itself.</p>

    <h2>The Disappearing Texture</h2>
    <p>Screens have replaced paper for most of our reading. Words are sharper, cleaner, endlessly scrollable — but they leave no mark, no smell, no warmth. There’s no pause when turning a page, no sound of paper moving, no weight in your hand. The convenience is undeniable, but something human gets lost in the exchange.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Books and paper remind us that ideas don’t only exist in words — they live in texture, touch, and time. In holding them, we hold a fragment of the past. They teach us that slowness can be beautiful, and that even silence — the space between pages — can speak.</p>
